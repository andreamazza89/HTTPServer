# HTTP Server

Small HTTP server implementation build as part of my apprenticeship at [8thLight](https://8thlight.com/).

To run, install java and maven, then compile using `mvn package` and run with
`java -jar /path/to/the/compiled/jar -p thePortNumberYouWantTheServerOn -d path/to/the/static/assets/folder`
